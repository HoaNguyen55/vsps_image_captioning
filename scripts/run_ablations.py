"""Score the verification ablations by replaying a Stage 1 run.

    python scripts/run_ablations.py --in ~/ncs-data/stage1

Every ablation here changes only how recorded probe answers are SCORED, never
which probes get asked. So the whole table comes from one Stage 1 run replayed
under different configurations: seconds on a CPU instead of re-running 3,769
images once per condition, which is around forty fleet-hours.

**Validate the harness first.** `validate_replay.py` must pass on the same
records, and its residual has to be quoted with these numbers. Three successive
versions of the replay looked correct and were not; a table built on an
unchecked replay describes a run that never happened.

**What this cannot do.** A1 (`mode = none`) and ablations that change the
PROMPT or the proposition set need a real run -- different questions get asked,
and a question never asked has no recorded answer. Those are marked and skipped
rather than silently approximated.
