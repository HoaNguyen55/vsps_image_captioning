"""Check that replaying a Stage 1 run reproduces the verdicts it recorded.

    python scripts/validate_replay.py --in ~/ncs-data/stage1

**Run this before trusting any number that came from a replay.** The harness
exists so a rule change can be scored on a CPU instead of six fleet-hours, and a
harness that quietly disagrees with its source is worse than no harness: it
produces confident numbers about a run that never happened.

That is not hypothetical. The first version reproduced 62.8% of its own source
and the gap turned out to be a real bug in `_answer_stability` -- string entropy
where polarity entropy was meant. The second reproduced 74.6% because the replay
returned an `Answer` with no `samples`, so every probe scored as perfectly
stable. The third reproduced 98.9% because a colour cross-check asks the SAME
question of two models and both answers landed under one key.

Each of those looked like a working tool until it was asked to reproduce
something known.
